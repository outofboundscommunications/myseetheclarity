== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**How do I disable the CSS styles for the datepicker**

By default the CSS styles from Gravity Forms are applied, regardless of what the Gravity Forms 'Output CSS' setting is set to.

If you want to disable these styles you will need to apply the filter below.

`add_filter( 'itsg_listdatepicker_usegfcss', function () {
	return true;
});`

**How do I set a default date format?**

The default date format is mm/dd/yyyy.

The 'itsg_list_field_datepicker_default_format' filter is available to set a default date format.

To set the default date format at dd/mm/yyyy you would use the following code

`add_filter( 'itsg_list_field_datepicker_default_format', 'change_default_format', 10, 4 );
function change_default_format( $fedault, $form_id, $field_id, $column_number) {
	return 'dmy';
}`

The other format options are:

*   **mdy** for mm/dd/yyyy
*   **dmy** for dd/mm/yyyy
*   **dmy_dash** for dd-mm-yyyy
*   **dmy_dot** for dd.mm.yyyy
*   **ymd_slash** for yyyy/mm/dd
*   **ymd_dash** for yyyy-mm-dd
*   **ymd_dot** for yyyy.mm.dd

**How do I set a default date?**

There are three ways to change the default date.

**1. Set the default date in the field settings**

Use the 'Default Date' option for the date picker enabled field in the form editor.

**2. Use the 'itsg_datepicker_fields' filter**

The 'itsg_datepicker_fields' filter can be used to set a default field for a particular field.

To use the filter you need to know the form id, the field id and the column position.

The example below shows how to use this filter on form id 50, field id 22 and column 1

`add_filter( 'itsg_datepicker_fields', function ( $datepicker_fields, $form_id ) {
	if ( 50 == $form_id ) {
		$datepicker_fields['22'] = array( '1' => date( 'm/d/Y', strtotime( 'friday this week' ) ) );
	}
	return $datepicker_fields;
}, 10, 2);`

**3. Use the 'itsg_default_datepicker_date' action to set a default date for all datepicker enabled list fields.**

The 'itsg_default_datepicker_date' action is available to set a default date.

To use this action you will need to add some code to your themes functions.php file, below the starting <?php line.

The action takes a date formatted as a string, for example 01/01/2015. Your code could return a simple date, e.g. 01/06/2015 or using the PHP date function you could create a dynamic date, such as 'Monday of this week'.

It is important that the format of the string matches the formatting of the date picker field.

The example below will set the default date to the Monday of the current week - note the date format is d/m/Y

`add_filter( 'itsg_default_datepicker_date', function () {
	return date("d/m/Y",strtotime('monday this week'));
});`

The example below will set the default date to 20 days ahead of the current date - note the date format is yyyy.mm.dd

`add_filter( 'itsg_default_datepicker_date', function () {
	return date("Y.m.d",strtotime('+20 days'));
});`

The example below will set the default date to 15-01-2015 (15 January 2015) - note the date format is d-m-Y

`add_filter( 'itsg_default_datepicker_date', function () {
	return '15-01-2015';
});`

The example below will set the default date to the first day of the following year - note the date format is in m/d/Y

`add_filter( 'itsg_default_datepicker_date', function () {
    return date("m/d/Y",strtotime('first day of January next year'));
});`

For more information on the strtotime function, see [strtotime](http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php)

For more information on the date function, see [date](http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php)

**How do I configure the datepicker**

Rocketgenius have documentation on how to configure the datepicker in Gravity Forms using the [gform_datepicker_options_pre_init hook](https://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/article/gform_datepicker_options_pre_init/#2-no-weekends).

As an example of how to implement this, the following code will disable weekends from the datepicker for all forms and all datepicker fields.

`	add_action('wp_footer', function () {
	?>
	<script>
	gform.addFilter( 'gform_datepicker_options_pre_init', function( optionsObj, formId, fieldId ) {
		optionsObj.firstDay = 1;
		optionsObj.beforeShowDay = jQuery.datepicker.noWeekends;
		return optionsObj;
	});
	</script>
	<?php
	},10);`
	
This plugin introduces a modifies version of 'gform_datepicker_options_pre_init' to allow you to target specific list field columns.

The example below shows how to use the filter against a list field column. Note the additional variable - columnNum.

`	add_action('wp_footer', function () {
	?>
	<script>
	gform.addFilter( 'gform_datepicker_options_pre_init', function( optionsObj, formId, fieldId, columnNum ) {
	if ( formId == 43 && fieldId == 24 && columnNum == 2 ) {
		optionsObj.minDate = '-10 Y';
		optionsObj.maxDate = 0;
	}
	return optionsObj;
	});
	</script>
	<?php
	},10);`

**How do I disable format validation for custom date formats**

By default this plugin will validate given dates to ensure it's in the right format.

If you're setting a non-standard date format, for example iso8601Week you will need to disable validation for the column(s).

You can do this for all forms or on a per-form, per-field, per-column basis.

The example below shows how to use the filter to disable validation for a particular column.

`add_filter( 'itsg_list_field_datepicker_disable_validation', 'itsg_disable_validation', 10, 4 );
function itsg_disable_validation( $default, $form_id, $field_id, $column_number ) {
	if ( 43 == $form_id && 31 == $field_id && 1 == $column_number ) {
		return true;
	}
}`
